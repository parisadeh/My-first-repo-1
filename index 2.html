        <h2>Green Animals In Need</h2>
        <p><img src="images/image 4.jpg" alt="pet 1">Neighbors, there are animals need our help! There are pets in
          Greene County who are in crisis. These pets are loved and have homes, but their owners are unable to fully
          care for their basic needs. My husband Charles and I, along with COFAS (Circle of Friends Animal Society) have
          been doing all we possibly can by supplying dog houses, food and medical supplies, but it is not enough.
          This crisis has inspired us to start The GAIN FUND. The mission of The GAIN Fund(Greene Animals in Need) is to
          assist pet owners who are in poverty, in the midst of a short-term emergency,
          financial setback, or are simply one vet bill away from giving away a beloved pet. No one should have to give
          up a pet because they cannot afford basic necessities!can by supplying dog houses, foocan by supplying dog
